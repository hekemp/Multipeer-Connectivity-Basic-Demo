An exploration for Topics in CS2: iOS Development, this is stage one in the development for a bigger app, which will be the final project for this class. 

This Swift project which shows the bare bones of getting two devices connected, and allows the sending of a String between the two devices. As I struggled to find a newer tutorial which used XCode 9 and Swift 4.0, I'm hoping that this tutorial will be able to help someone else get started with MultipeerConeectivity.

Specs:

-- Utalizes MultipeerConnectivity library
-- XCode 9 Beta
-- Swift 4.0
